First you need to reset your password (through Visit button in received mail) and then you are redirected right to Taikun login page. By filling E-mail and newly created Password , you will login to Taikun. First page you see is Dashboard of your organization. If Keycloak is set for your organization, you can use it to login. If you forget your password , you can reset it. See how to change your password * here and how to change your e-mail * here . Add Cloud Credentials \u00b6 Before you can create your own project, you have to add a cloud. Now you can choose from OpenStack, AWS or Azure. You just have to fill in correct credentials from your account and Taikun will connect with them. OpenStack \u00b6 Before connecting the openstack cloud, you have to fulfill the requirements . If you have trouble adding openstack credentials, see how fill the fields and where to find credentials . AWS \u00b6 If you have trouble adding AWS credentials, see how fill the fields and where to find credentials . Azure \u00b6 Before connecting the cloud you have to create application registration with commands. If you have trouble adding AWS credentials, see how fill the fields (at the bottom of the page) and where to find credentials . Project Creation \u00b6 After you have successfully added cloud credentials, you can add a project! During project creation, you can choose a lot of features. In Access Profile , Alerting Profile and Kubernetes Profile you have by default option default . These profiles are created with new organization creation. You can also create a new profile and then choose from drop-down selection. If you want to enable backup, you have to add backup credentials first. {% hint style=\"danger\" %} ACCESS PROFILE If you want to use your access profile in a project, you have to create it BEFORE and choose it from drop down selection DURING project creation. After the project is CREATED you CANNOT ADD ACCESS PROFILE. {% endhint %} Project can be created only by manager or partner, who then has to assign the project to the user (if they want them to have access to the project). More information about project creation for Manager and Partner . Creating a Cluster \u00b6 For a functional cluster you need one bastion, at least one kubemaster and at least one kubeworker. {% hint style=\"info\" %} Recommendation for sizing: bastion recommended 2 vCPU + 2GB of RAM masters recommended 4 vCPU + 8GB of RAM {% endhint %} You can add and delete servers until you are satisfied with the cluster, then you can commit (under Actions drop-down). You can updated almost all the features either directly from Project Details ( User , Manager , Partner ) like enable backup, enable/disable monitoring, attach/detach alerting profile or under specific tabs like updating Access Profile , Kubernetes Profile . Please keep in mind that some changes need Repair, which takes some time (e.g. updating Access Profile ). See more information about cluster creation .

Backup credentials - Taikun is uses AWS S3 backup. S3 (Simple Storage Service) Backup is a desktop application using Amazon\u2019s infrastructure for remote backups and secure online file storage. It features very strong encryption, compression, easy access to your backed up files and backup scheduling built in. Backup policy - defines the ground rules for planning, executing and validating backups and includes specific activities to ensure that critical data is backed up to secure storage media located in a secure location. schedules=policies backups=a copy created based on policy restores=a copy from backup data Billing Rules - rules for C_hargeback_. Every rule is based on external source, metrics and price. Chargeback - external billing set by Billing Rules , you can see the price for every rule for selected time period. Cloud - a global network of servers, each with a unique function. These servers are designed to either store and manage data, run applications, or deliver content or a service such as streaming videos, web mail, office productivity software, or social media. Cloud operates as a single ecosystem. Taikun is now supporting OpenStack, AWS, Azure and we are planning to support GCP as well. Cluster = project - a set of computers hat work together so that they can be viewed as a single system Kubernetes cluster - a set of nodes that run containerized applications. Containerizing applications packages an app with its dependencies and some necessary services. They are more lightweight and flexible than virtual machines. In this way, Kubernetes clusters allow for applications to be more easily developed, moved and managed. CNI - Container Network Interface, consists of a specification and libraries for writing plugins to configure network interfaces in Linux containers, along with a number of supported plugins. CNI Credentials - data confirming the identity of the user or external application (e.g. the user name and password, user name and API key, or authentication token that the identity service provide). In Taikun you can find Cloud Credentials, Backup Credentials, Billing Credentials and Showback Credentials. CSM - Customer Success Manager Endpoint - a remote computing device that communicates back and forth with a network to which it is connected (usually URL address). Flavor - is an available hardware configuration for a server. Defines the compute, memory, and storage capacity of nova computing instances Floating IP - a kind of virtual IP address that can be dynamically routed to any server in the same network. Multiple servers can own the same Floating IP address, but it can only be active on one server at any given time. Import network - use the network already created in cloud (works for OpenStack) Keycloak - an open source software product to allow single sign-on with Identity and Access Management aimed at modern applications and services. Keycloak Kubeconfig file - a file used to configure access to Kubernetes when used in conjunction with the kubectl commandline tool (or other clients). Kubeconfig Kubernetes - a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. Kubernetes Kubernetes Profile - a profile for enabling kubernetes function and features (such as Octavia , Load Balancer or Proxy on bastion ) Load Balancer - refers to the process of distributing a set of tasks over a set of resources (computing units), with the aim of making their overall processing more efficient. Load balancing can optimize the response time and avoid unevenly overloading some compute nodes while other compute nodes are left idle. Metrics - measure specific characteristics in a countable manner. Metrics are used in monitoring and billing . Monitoring - is the process to gather metrics about the operations, to ensure everything functions as expected to support applications and services. By enabling monitoring you can see Logs, Alerts or Metrics. Node - a worker machine in Kubernetes and may be either a virtual or a physical machine, depending on the cluster . Nodes Octavia - exposes the Service externally using the load balancers from OpenStack. Pod - the smallest execution unit in Kubernetes . A pod encapsulates one or more applications. Pods Project = cluster - a set of computers hat work together so that they can be viewed as a single system Kubernetes cluster - a set of nodes that run containerized applications. Containerizing applications packages an app with its dependences and some necessary services. They are more lightweight and flexible than virtual machines. In this way, Kubernetes clusters allow for applications to be more easily developed, moved and managed. Proxy on Bastion - exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port, the NodePort. You'll be able to contact the NodePort Service, from outside the cluster, by requesting \\ :\\ . Reboot - to reload the operating system of a computer: to start it up again. HARD - the power to the system is physically turned off and back again causing an initial boot SOFT - system restarts without the need to interrupt the power Role - defines the rights and permissions granted to user accounts. In Taikun there are User , Manager (Owner) or Partner . You can take a look at each role in User Guide . Showback - internal billing set by Showback Rules , you can see the price for every rule for selected time period. You can also set external source for billing. Showback Rules - rules for Showback . Every rule is based on metrics and price. Subscription - an amount of money that you pay regularly to use Taikun. Price is various depending on the number of users, projects or TCU. Token - an alphanumeric text string that provides access to APIs and resources. User - digital representation of a person using Taikun. Each user is defined by username (e-mail) and the access is granted by token . User has assigned role with its permissions.

Here you can see all servers for the project with their description. Project Info \u00b6 Under Servers title is a brief description of the project - such as Project Name , Project Status , Cloud Type , Kubernetes Version , Access Profile , Cloud Credentials , Kubernetes Profile , Alerting Profile , Access IP Address (if you use this address to ssh connect, please do not use user ubuntu, it's in use by Taikun for managing the cluster) and Kubernetes Health . Some of these include links to e.g. cloud or profiles. You can also see here ETC=Estimated Time to Complete. It is approx time (in minutes) until the cluster will be completed. Servers \u00b6 Every server is described by ID , Server Name , IP Address , Flavor , CPU/RAM/Disk Size , Role , Status, Kubernetes Health , Creation Time and Actions . If you expand the table, you can see the last modification made ( Last Modified , Last Modified By ). Server status can be: Deleting Failure Pending Pending Delete Pending Upgrade Ready Updating Upgrading Actions Show Status - shows current status from the cloud for 3 seconds Reboot - choose HARD or SOFT reboot for each server HARD - the power to the system is physically turned off and back again causing an initial boot SOFT - system restarts without the need to interrupt the power {% hint style=\"info\" %} Hard or soft reboot can be chosen only for Openstack.

The button is disabled, if your Kubernetes are up to date. Enabling auto upgrade during the project creation, the Upgrade button won't be available. Enable/Disable Backup \u00b6 You can * Enable Backup if you have added the credentials in Backup Credentials and the project isn't locked. You can do it during the project creation or after the project is created, more info here . * After you enable the backup, you get notified through Notification and you can check the successful status in Kubernetes. In Projects - Kubernetes - Deployment section you should see velero installed. After enabling backup, you need to add Backup Policies . Enable/Disable Monitoring \u00b6 Be able to see detailed processes with enabling monitoring. After you enable it, which takes up to 5 minutes, you can preview all tracks with Logs button. The tracking starts the moment Logs button is enabled. You can enable monitoring before project creation or (if you forgot or have changed your mind) whenever your project is created. Disable function works the same. Commit \u00b6 Sends the changes to repository. Once the cluster is committed you will see ETC in project info. Repair \u00b6 When the server/s are Failed or there is some other problem in the cluster, it can be repaired by changing the status to Ready . If all the servers have failed during the first creation, the repair button works as commit and you should use it. If only one server is failed, you should change only the one server's status, because repair will restart the status of all servers. Attach/Detach Alerting Profile \u00b6 Attach **** Alerting Profile if you want to receive a notifications about alerts in your project. Detach if notifications are no longer needed. Lock/ Unlock \u00b6 Project is unlocked Clicking the button you lock a project.

Function buttons Between Project Info and Servers are buttons with specific features or more detailed information. Delete \u00b6 Delete the selected server/s. You can delete servers to still have a working cluster (1 bastion, 1 master and 1 worker) or delete the whole working cluster. {% hint style=\"warning\" %} The change DOES NOT have to be committed. {% endhint %} History \u00b6 This button will redirect you to Audit Log with project, so you can preview the changes made for the chosen project. Kubeconfigs \u00b6 Add a new kubernetes configuration for your profile and project. Kubeconfig Name - choose a name for your kubeconfig (2-230 characters) Kubeconfig Role cluster-admin - perform any action on any resource, ClusterRoleBinding - gives full control over every resource in the cluster and in all namespaces (or in very resource in the role binding's namespace - RoleBinding) admin - RoleBinding - allows read/write access to most resources in a namespace, does not allow write access to resource quota or to the namespace itself edit - allows read/write access to most objects in a namespace, does not allow viewing or modifying roles or role bindings, allows accessing Secrets and running Pods as any ServiceAccount in the namespace view - see most objects in a namespace, does not allow viewing roles or role bindings, does not allow viewing Secrets {% hint style=\"info\" %} For more info, see kubernetes documentation . {% endhint %} Application kubeconfig - choose if kubeconfig can be used by other users ( all or managers only ) or Personal kubeconfig - kubeconfig can be used only by you You can see all project's configurations in the table with its ID , Name , User Name , User Role , Project , Accessible for all and Actions . Actions \u00b6 This .yaml file can be download and use to organize information about clusters, users, namespaces, and authentication mechanisms. Delete your kube config if it is no longer needed. You can also delete user's or partner's kube configs. Kube Info \u00b6 If Kubernetes is active, Kube Info button will redirect you to the Kubernetes configuration. For more see Projects - Kubernetes . Events \u00b6 You are redirected to **** Events, where you can see all Kubernetes changes made in the project.

This section is refreshed every 5 minutes, but you can also use the refresh button to see the most updated data. To see all alerts, use upper right Show All Alerts button. As seen above, firing alerts are marked with red color. You can silence alert and sort all the alerts by firing, silenced, all or resolved. Alerts are accessible only if Monitoring is enabled and the project is not empty. For each alert you can see details and use a link that will redirected you to Metrics **** with the query already filled. The index number at Alerts shows the number of firing alerts. When the firing alerts are resolved, the number disappears. Firing alerts also work from the real-time notifications bell in header. The notification contains a brief message on a specific project and bellow the message is time of the change. After clicking Show Project , you can access the project in which the alert is. As the name suggests: Mark as Read and Dismiss all . Metrics \u00b6 Write a query, search Prometheus Metrics and preview the value needed. Modify Step or Date .
