First you need to reset your password (through Visit button in received mail) and then you are redirected right to Taikun login page. By filling E-mail and newly created Password , you will login to Taikun. First page you see is the Dashboard of your organization. If Keycloak is set for your organization, you can use it to login. Fig .1: First login If you forget your password , you can reset it. See how to change your password here and how to change your e-mail here . Add Cloud Credentials \u00b6 Manager Partner Before you can create your own project, you have to add a cloud. Now you can choose from OpenStack, AWS or Azure. You just have to fill in correct credentials from your account and Taikun will connect with them. OpenStack \u00b6 Before connecting the openstack cloud, you have to fulfill the requirements . Fig .2: Openstack cloud credentials If you have trouble adding openstack credentials, see how fill the fields and where to find credentials . AWS \u00b6 Fig .3: AWS cloud credentials If you have trouble adding AWS credentials, see how fill the fields and where to find credentials . Azure \u00b6 Before connecting the cloud you have to create application registration through commands. Fig .4: Azure cloud credentials If you have trouble adding Azure credentials, see how fill the fields (at the bottom of the page) and where to find credentials . Project Creation \u00b6 Manager Partner After you have successfully added cloud credentials, you can add a project! During project creation, you can choose a lot of features. Fig .5: Add project In Access Profile , Alerting Profile and Kubernetes Profile you have by default option default . These profiles are created with every new organization. You can also create a new profile and then choose from drop-down selection. If you want to enable backup, you have to add backup credentials first, same with policy profile. Some of these features can be added/enabled after project is created: add/detach alerting or policy profile , enable monitoring or backup , add expiration date . Warning ACCESS PROFILE If you want to use your access profile in a project, you have to create it BEFORE and choose it from drop down selection DURING project creation. After the project is CREATED you CANNOT ADD ACCESS PROFILE** Project can be created only by manager or partner, who then has to assign the project to the user (if they want them to have access to the project). More information about project creation for Manager and Partner . Creating a Cluster \u00b6 User Manager Partner For a functional cluster you need one bastion, at least one kubemaster and at least one kubeworker. Info Recommendation for sizing: - bastion recommended 2 vCPU + 2GB of RAM - masters recommended 4 vCPU + 8GB of RAM Fig .6: Create cluster You can add and delete servers until you are satisfied with the cluster, then you can commit your changes. You can update some of the features either directly from Project Details (depend on role permissions - User , Manager , Partner ) like enable backup, enable/disable monitoring, attach/detach alerting profile or under specific tabs like updating Access Profile , Kubernetes Profile . Please keep in mind that some changes need Repair , which takes some time (e.g. updating Access Profile ). See more information about cluster creation .

Backup credentials - Taikun is uses AWS S3 backup. S3 (Simple Storage Service) Backup is a desktop application using Amazon\u2019s infrastructure for remote backups and secure online file storage. It features very strong encryption, compression, easy access to your backed up files and backup scheduling built in. Backup policy - defines the ground rules for planning, executing and validating backups and includes specific activities to ensure that critical data is backed up to secure storage media located in a secure location. schedules=policies backups=a copy created based on policy restores=a copy from backup data Billing Rules - rules for Chargeback . Every rule is based on external source, metrics and price. Chargeback - external billing set by Billing Rules , you can see the price for every rule for selected time period. Cloud - a global network of servers, each with a unique function. These servers are designed to either store and manage data, run applications, or deliver content or a service such as streaming videos, web mail, office productivity software, or social media. Cloud operates as a single ecosystem. Taikun is now supporting OpenStack, AWS, Azure and we are planning to support GCP as well. Cluster = project - a set of computers hat work together so that they can be viewed as a single system Kubernetes cluster - a set of nodes that run containerized applications. Containerizing applications packages an app with its dependencies and some necessary services. They are more lightweight and flexible than virtual machines. In this way, Kubernetes clusters allow for applications to be more easily developed, moved and managed. CNI - Container Network Interface, consists of a specification and libraries for writing plugins to configure network interfaces in Linux containers, along with a number of supported plugins. CNI Credentials - data confirming the identity of the user or external application (e.g. the user name and password, user name and API key, or authentication token that the identity service provide). In Taikun you can find Cloud Credentials, Backup Credentials, Billing Credentials and Showback Credentials. CSM - Customer Success Manager Endpoint - a remote computing device that communicates back and forth with a network to which it is connected (usually URL address). Flavor - is an available hardware configuration for a server. Defines the compute, memory, and storage capacity of nova computing instances Floating IP - a kind of virtual IP address that can be dynamically routed to any server in the same network. Multiple servers can own the same Floating IP address, but it can only be active on one server at any given time. Import network - use the network already created in cloud (works for OpenStack) Keycloak - an open source software product to allow single sign-on with Identity and Access Management aimed at modern applications and services. Keycloak Kubeconfig file - a file used to configure access to Kubernetes when used in conjunction with the kubectl commandline tool (or other clients). Kubeconfig Kubernetes - a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. Kubernetes Kubernetes Profile - a profile for enabling kubernetes function and features (such as Octavia , Load Balancer or Proxy on bastion ) Load Balancer - refers to the process of distributing a set of tasks over a set of resources (computing units), with the aim of making their overall processing more efficient. Load balancing can optimize the response time and avoid unevenly overloading some compute nodes while other compute nodes are left idle. Metrics - measure specific characteristics in a countable manner. Metrics are used in monitoring and billing . Monitoring - is the process to gather metrics about the operations, to ensure everything functions as expected to support applications and services. By enabling monitoring you can see Logs, Alerts or Metrics. Node - a worker machine in Kubernetes and may be either a virtual or a physical machine, depending on the cluster . Nodes Octavia - exposes the Service externally using the load balancers from OpenStack. Pod - the smallest execution unit in Kubernetes . A pod encapsulates one or more applications. Pods Project = cluster - a set of computers hat work together so that they can be viewed as a single system Kubernetes cluster - a set of nodes that run containerized applications. Containerizing applications packages an app with its dependences and some necessary services. They are more lightweight and flexible than virtual machines. In this way, Kubernetes clusters allow for applications to be more easily developed, moved and managed. Proxy on Bastion - exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port, the NodePort. You'll be able to contact the NodePort Service, from outside the cluster, by requesting NodeIP:NodePort. Reboot - to reload the operating system of a computer: to start it up again. HARD - the power to the system is physically turned off and back again causing an initial boot SOFT - system restarts without the need to interrupt the power Role - defines the rights and permissions granted to user accounts. In Taikun there are User , Manager (Owner) or Partner . You can take a look at each role in User Guide . Showback - internal billing set by Showback Rules , you can see the price for every rule for selected time period. You can also set external source for billing. Showback Rules - rules for Showback . Every rule is based on metrics and price. Subscription - an amount of money that you pay regularly to use Taikun. Price is various depending on the number of users, projects or TCU. Token - an alphanumeric text string that provides access to APIs and resources. User - digital representation of a person using Taikun. Each user is defined by username (e-mail) and the access is granted by token . User has assigned role with its permissions.

The latter will allow you to use Terraform to manage resources in Taikun. Annotations \u00b6 Text in this form is to be typed, as is, on the command line. cd workshop/ ls echo Hello! This form of text shows screen output, usually the output of commands. task_00/ task_01/ ... Hello! This format is for code in Terraform\u2019s configuration language, HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). resource \"aws_instance\" \"example\" { ami = \"abc123\" network_interface { ... } } You may wish to skip reading information blocks if you are already familiar with Terraform and its configu- ration syntax. Tip Some information about Terraform... Setup \u00b6 To complete this workshop, you will need to install Terraform and the workshop files. There are two ways to do this. - If you wish to install Terraform and the workshop files locally, read Local setup. - To use the provided Docker image which already contains everything you need. Setup using Docker. \u00b6 Local setup \u00b6 Requirements \u00b6 You must have Terraform version 0.14 or newer installed. You will need Git to clone the provider\u2019s repo. Installing Terraform \u00b6 This Hashicorp tutorial explains how to install Terraform on OS X, Windows and Linux. Downloading the workshop files \u00b6 Clone the workshop directory and switch into the workshop/ directory. git clone https://github.com/itera-io/terraform-provider-taikun-workshop.git cd terraform-provider-taikun-workshop/workshop/ Setup using Docker \u00b6 Requirements \u00b6 You must have Docker and Git installed. Setup \u00b6 Start by cloning the workshop repository. git clone --recursive https://github.com/itera-io/terraform-provider-taikun-workshop.git Docker image creation \u00b6 You\u2019ll need to build the image, this operation can take several minutes. DOCKER_BUILDKIT = 1 docker build --rm --target bin -t tf-workshop . Docker container creation \u00b6 To create the Docker container, run one of the following commands from the root of terrraform-provider-taikun-workshop . On Windows, run the following command in the command prompt (not Powershell). docker run -v %CD%/workshop:/root/workshop --name tf-workshop -it tf-workshop \u2022 On Linux and MacOS: docker run -v $( pwd ) /workshop:/root/workshop --name tf-workshop -it tf-workshop This will mount the workshop/directory in the Docker container and log you in to the container as root. In other words, you will need to run terraform commands from within the container shell, however you can edit the files in workshop/directory with the editor of your choice on your machine. Restarting the Docker container \u00b6 You can exit the container at any time without losing your progress. If you have exited the Docker container, run the following command to restart it. docker start -i tf-workshop Text editing within the container \u00b6 If you wish to edit the files in workshop/directory from within the container, the Docker image has the vim, micro and nano packages installed. If you are unfamiliar with Nano and Vim keybindings, the Micro editor has traditional Common User Access keybindings (Ctrl-C for copy, Ctrl-Z for undo, etc). Documentation \u00b6 The provider documentation is available on the Terraform Registry. Tasks \u00b6 The end goal of this workshop is to have an operational Taikun project built solely with Terraform configuration files. By following a step by step process, you will discover how various Taikun resources are declared and managed using Terraform. All your work will be done in the workshop/directory. These are its initial contents. ./workshop/ | -- main.tf | -- taikun_auth.auto.tfvars | -- variables.tf main.tf contains the Provider configuration, namely its source address and what credentials to use. You will not need to edit this file. # main.tf terraform { required_providers { taikun = { source = \"itera-io/taikun\" version = \"1.0.0\" } } } provider \"taikun\" { email = var.taikun_email password = var.taikun_password } Terraform reads its configuration from all the files with the extension .tf , in the working directory. Having the provider configuration in main.tf is simply a convention. During this workshop, each task should be coded in a separate config file. At the end of the workshop, your directory will be organized as such ./workshop/ |-- main.tf |-- taikun_auth.auto.tfvars |-- task0.tf |-- task1.tf |-- task2.tf |-- task3.auto.tfvars |-- task3.tf |-- task4.tf |-- task5.tf |-- task6.tf |-- task7.tf |-- variables.tf |-- users.auto.tfvars |-- users.tf Authentication \u00b6 In order to complete the tasks that follow, you will need to provide Taikun credentials to Terraform. You will need a Partner account as some of the tasks, such as creating an organization, require Partner privileges. Input variables will be explained later in the workshop. For now, simply edit taikun_auth.auto.tfvars and replace the values of taikun_email and taikun_password with your credentials. # taikun_auth.auto.tfvars taikun_email = \"jane.doe@itera.io\" taikun_password = \"PassWord123\" To find out more about providing sensitive data to Terraform, see this Hashicorp tutorial. Task 0: Organization \u00b6 Note For this task, please write your code in the file 'task0.tf' at the root of the workshop/directory. This objective of this first task is to create an organization. All resources created in the future will be part of this organization. As this is the first task, every step of the process is documented. Before you do anything, start by preparing your working directory for other commands. terraform init Tip terraform init only needs to be run once when starting a new project or after updating the list of providers to use. If all went well, you should see the following message. Initializing the backend... [ ... ] Terraform has been successfully initialized! Once Terraform has been initialized correctly, you can declare your organization resource. Create 'task0.tf' and write the following configuration block to it. resource \"taikun_organization\" \"myorg\" { name = \"<name>\" full_name = \"<full-name>\" discount_rate = 120 } Be sure to replace and with names of your choosing. You can also choose another label instead of myorg. Tip Notice the syntax of the configuration block, as you are creating a resource, it begins with the keyword resource, followed by its type between double quotes. The type of resource is always lowercase and prefixed by the name of the provider, thus \"taikun_organization\". Following the resource\u2019s type is a label, it must be unique for this type of resource, and is used to refer to this specific resource, as you will find out later. Watch out, this label does not correspond to the name of the resource in Taikun Three arguments are then defined: name, full_name and discount_rate. On the left side of the equals sign is the argument\u2019s identifier, on the right is its value. See the documentation of Taikun\u2019s organization resource for a full list of arguments, i.e. the resource\u2019s schema. Labels and argument names can contain letters, digits, underscores and hyphens and may not start with a digit. Run the following command to reformat your configuration in the standard style. terraform fmt Now apply your changes. Tip If you have already created resources, apply will refresh Terraform\u2019s state by making request to Taikun\u2019s API. If you wish to check the validity of your changes without refreshing the state, you can run terraform validate. terraform apply You should get a validation error. Error: expected discount_rate to be in the range (0.000000 - 100.000000), got 120.000000 Now fix the discount rate so it is in the range 0-100 and run apply once more. Terraform will display a list of resources to create. After checking the plan is correct, type yes to execute it. Tip You should notice a file terraform.tfstate in your working directory, Terraform uses this file to keep track of the state, do not modify or delete it. You may now list the resources in Terraform\u2019s state. terraform state list You can also display their content. terraform show taikun_organization.myorg: resource \"taikun_organization\" \"myorg\" { created_at = \"2021-11-05T14:00:50Z\" discount_rate = 42 full_name = \"Jane Doe's organization\" id = \"6383\" is_read_only = false lock = false managers_can_change_subscription = true name = \"my-organization\" partner_id = \"119\" partner_name = \"TF-CI\" projects = 0 servers = 0 } You may wish to check the organization was indeed created at app.taikun.cloud/organizations. Tip Try running terraform apply again, Terraform will refresh its state, and, as long as nothing has changed, tell you that no changes are needed. You can also try deleting the organization through the web UI and running terraform apply. Terraform will tell you that changes have occured outside of Terraform and recreate the resource Task 1: Kubernetes Profile \u00b6 Note For this task, please write your code in the file task1.tf at the root of the workshop/directory. Now that you have created an organization, you will create a Kubernetes profile belonging to it. Check the kubernetes_profile resource\u2019s schema on the provider\u2019s documentation and declare the resource in task1.tf. Set organization_id to the ID of the organization created in the previous task (see Task 0: Organization). Feel free to set some of kubernetes_profile\u2019s other optional attributes, such as schedule_on_master and load_balancing_solution . Once you have declared your resource, apply your changes and move on to the next task. Tip To refer to the ID of your organization, use the following syntax. resource.taikun_organization.myorg.id Make sure to replace myorg if you used another label for your organization. Task 2: Slack Configuration & Alerting Profile \u00b6 Note For this task, please write your code in the file task2.tf at the root of the workshop/directory. You will now create an alerting profile using a Slack configuration. Start by declaring a Slack configuration. Here is its documentation. Its hook URL should be https://hooks.myapp.example/ci. It must send alert-type notifications only to the channel ci. You can now declare the alerting profile. Here is its documentation. The alerting profile should send notifications daily using the Slack configuration declared above. Important As always, your resources should belong to the organization created in Task 0: Organization. Once you have declared these two new resources, apply your changes and move on to the next task. Task 3: Cloud Credentials \u00b6 Note For this task, please write your code in the file task3.tf at the root of the workshop/directory. You will also be editing task3.auto.tfvars . Important You will need OpenStack credentials to complete this task. Cloud credentials are needed to create a Taikun project. In a real work environment, cloud credentials should not be stored under version control Terraform\u2019s input variables help solve this problem. Variables are declared in variables.tf by convention. This file declares the variables taikun_email and taikun_password used for authentication. # variables.tf variable \"taikun_email\" { description = \"Taikun email\" type = string sensitive = true } variable \"taikun_password\" { description = \"Taikun password\" type = string sensitive = true } Tip Input variables are declared with a variable block. The label that follows the variable keyword is the name of the variable. \u2022 The description argument is used to specifiy the variable\u2019s documentation. \u2022 type is the type of this argument\u2019s value. \u2022 If set to true, sensitive will hide this variable\u2019s value in Terraform output. It defaults to false. To know more about input variables and a full list of arguments, see the Terraform documentation on variables. Variables are then defined in .tfvars files, as seen in subsection Authentication. For the sake of simplicity, variables will be declared in the task/ .tf files. Thus, in task3.tf*, insert the following variable declarations variable \"openstack_url\" { description = \"OpenStack url\" type = string sensitive = true } variable \"openstack_user\" { description = \"OpenStack user\" type = string sensitive = true } variable \"openstack_password\" { description = \"OpenStack password\" type = string sensitive = true } variable \"openstack_domain\" { description = \"OpenStack domain\" type = string sensitive = true } variable \"openstack_region\" { description = \"OpenStack region\" type = string } variable \"openstack_public_network\" { description = \"OpenStack public network\" type = string } variable \"openstack_project\" { description = \"OpenStack project name\" type = string } Note If copy-pasting this code block into task3.tf does not indent the code properly, save task3.tf and run terraform fmt. Now that the OpenStack variables have been declared, define the variables in task3.auto.tfvars using your credentials. Terraform must be told through command line arguments which .tfvars files to read. However, if variable definition files have the extension .auto.tfvars, as is the case with taikun_auth.auto.tfvars, Terraform will automatically fetch the variables\u2019 values. Tip As a reminder, here is the syntax used in taikun_auth.auto.tfvars to define the variables taikun_email and taikun_password. taikun_email = \"jane.doe@itera.io\" taikun_password = \"PassWord123\" Tip In order to get a variable\u2019s value, use the syntax var. . For example, the following line sets the OpenStack domain in the cloud_credential_openstack resource. domain = var.openstack_domain Once you have declared your new resource, apply your changes and move on to the next task. Important As always, your resources should belong to the organization created in Task 0: Organization Task 4: Users \u00b6 Note For this task, please write your code in the file task4.tf at the root of the workshop/directory. You will also be editing users.tf and users.auto.tfvars . You will now add users to the Taikun organization. As the organization could have a large amount of users, you will use variables and the keyword for_each to avoid declaring multiple taikun_user blocks. Add the following variable declaration to users.tf . variable \"users\" { type = map(object({ email = string role = string })) description = \"List of project users\" default = {} } The users variable is of a complex type: a map of objects with two arguments, email and role. The keys of the map are strings, they will be the usernames of the users. The default = {} argument definition tells Terraform that the default value of var.users is an empty map. Here is an example definition of the users variable. users = { \"alice\" = { email = \"alice@gmail.com\" role = \"Manager\" }, \"bob\" = { email = \"bob@gmail.com\" role = \"User\" }, } In this example, user accounts are defined for Alice and Bob. \u2022 Alice has a Manager account with the username alice and the email alice@gmail.com . \u2022 Bob has a User account with the username bob and the email bob@gmail.com . Now edit users.auto.tfvars and define three users. \u2022 -manager with Manager role and the email -manager@mail.example. \u2022 -user1 with User role and the email -user1@mail.example. \u2022 -user2 with User role and the email -user2@mail.example. Replace with a name of your choosing. You can now declare the user resource in task4.tf, the users must belong to the organization created in Task 0: Organization. Here is its documentation. By using the for_each keyword, only one resource block is needed. Tip Here is an example using the for_each keyword. Consider a Terraform provider to order pizzas. Sup- pose the variable pizza_orders has the following definition. pizza_orders = { \"alice\" = { type = \"pepperoni\" size = \"large\" }, \"bob\" = { type = \"amatriciana\" size = \"medium\" }, } Here is how it would be used with the for_each keyword in a pizza_order resource. resource \"pizza_order\" \"orders\" { for_each = var.pizza_orders client = each.key type = each.value.type size = each.value.size } You can also have a look at Terraform\u2019s for_each documentation. Once you have declared the user resource, apply your changes and move on to the next task. Task 5: Access Profile \u00b6 Note For this task, please write your code in the file task5.tf at the root of the workshop/directory. You will also be editing users.tf and users.auto.tfvars. Before creating your first project, you will need an access profile. The access profile must contain SSH keys for all the users created in the previous task, Task 4: Users. Rather than declare the SSH keys in a separate variable, you will add them to the users variable to declare them on per user basis. Modify users\u2019s declaration in users.tf to include a list of SSH users per user. variable \"users\" { type = map(object({ email = string role = string ssh_users = list(object({ name = string public_key = string })) })) description = \"List of project users\" default = {} } You can now edit users.auto.tfvars and define a list of SSH users for each user. Considering the previous example of Alice and Bob, here is the same definition of users with added SSH users. users = { \"alice\" = { email = \"alice@gmail.com\" role = \"Manager\" ssh_users = [ { name = \"alice-work\" public_key = \"ssh-ed25519 AAAATHEQUICKBROWNFOXJUMPEDOVERTHELAZYDOG example\" }, { name = \"alice-home\" public_key = \"ssh-ed25519 AAAATHEQUICKBROWNFOXJUMPEDOVERTHELAZYDOG example\" } ] }, \"bob\" = { email = \"bob@gmail.com\" role = \"User\" ssh_users = [ { name = \"bob-laptop\" public_key = \"ssh-ed25519 AAAATHEQUICKBROWNFOXJUMPEDOVERTHELAZYDOG example\" } ] }, } Add as many SSH users as you wish to the users defined in the previous task. Of course, you will need to use valid SSH keys. If you do not wish to create your own, here is a public key value you can use: ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIB/8P0zXmI/Il81+/fnvGrf0X/VyNTrOJ9nQCxBxjc5m taikun Important Within one access profile, the names of SSH users must be unique. You can now declare the taikun_access_profile resource in task5.tf . You will use for_each in a slightly different manner as ssh_user is a nested resource within the access_profile resource. Here is the documen- tation of the access profile resource. The access profile\u2019s requirements are: \u2022 It should use the DNS servers 8.8.8.8 and 1.1.1.1. \u2022 It should use the NTP server time.windows.com. \u2022 It should include all the SSH users defined in users.auto.tfvars. Tip While reading access profile\u2019s schema, you may notice dns_server and ntp_server are of the type Block List. Going back to the pizza order example, here is how block lists are used. Suppose the pizza_order resource has an argument extra_topping defined as such: - extra_topping (Block List, Max: 5) List of extra pizza toppings. (see below for nested schema) Nested Schema for extra_topping Required: - name (String) Name of the extra topping - quantity (Number) Quantity Here is how Alice could add mozzarella di bufala and basil to her amatriciana pizza order. resource \"pizza_order\" \"orders\" { client = \"alice\" type = \"amatriciana\" size = \"large\" extra_topping { name = \"basil leaves\" quantity = 8 } extra_topping { name = \"bufala slices\" quantity = 4 } } Note The code to define the SSH users of the access profile is provided below. However, if you wish to give it a go yourself first, here is how. To define the ssh_user argument, you will need to use a dynamic block with the for_each keyword. You will also need to extract the list of all SSH users from the users variable. for expressions and the flatten function will be of use. Spoiler ahead! Solution: Add the following dynamic \"ssh_user\" block to your access profile\u2019s configuration. resource \"taikun_access_profile\" \"...\" { # Rest of configuration: DNS servers, NTP servers, etc. # ... dynamic \"ssh_user\" { for_each = flatten([for user in var.users : user.ssh_users]) content { name = ssh_user.value.name public_key = ssh_user.value.public_key } } } Once you have fully declared the access profile resource, apply your changes and move on to the next task. Task 6: Project \u00b6 Note For this task, please write all your code in the file task6.tf at the root of the workshop/directory. Finally, you can declare a project resource. However, as flavors must be bound to the project, you must first fetch a list of suitable flavors. To do this, declare a flavors datasource. Datasources, as opposed to resources, only fetch information from providers and do not create any resources. Add the following block to task6.tf . data \"taikun_flavors\" \"small\" { # FIXME } Tip As you are declaring a datasource and not a resource, the block begins with the keyword data instead of resource. Once again, the type of datasource is in lowercase and must be prefixed by the name of the provider. Finally, the label \"small\" is used to designate this datasource. Edit the datasource to search for flavors with 4 or fewer CPUs and no more than 8GB of RAM. Set its cloud credential ID to that of the cloud credential created in Task 3: Cloud Credentials. Then declare a local value flavors to be the list of names of the flavors read by the datasource. See the Terraform documentation to know more about local values. locals { flavors = [for flavor in data.taikun_flavors.small.flavors : flavor.name] } This will allow you to refer to the list of flavor names with local.flavors, which will be useful when defining the project. You now have everything you need to create a project in Taikun. Here is its documentation. These are the requirements for the project resource: \u2022 As all previous resources, it must belong to the organization created in Task 0: Organization. \u2022 It must use the kubernetes profile defined in Task 1: Kubernetes Profile. \u2022 Its alerting profile must be the one defined in Task 2: Slack Configuration & Alerting Profile. \u2022 It should use the cloud credentials defined in Task 3: Cloud Credentials. \u2022 Monitoring must be enabled. \u2022 It should have one bastion, one kubemaster and one kubeworker. Tip To access the first element of a list, use the syntax list[index]. For example, to get the first flavor read by the flavors datasource, use local.flavors[0] . After creating a project with Terraform, one may want to know its access IP. Once you have declared the project resource, add the following output block to task6.tf . output \"project_access_ip\" { value = resource.taikun_project.<project-label>.access_ip } Make sure to replace with the label you gave your project. This will display the project\u2019s access IP once it has been created.- Tip Output values are a way for the user to output a specific value from Terraform\u2019s state. An output value block begins with the keyword output followed by a unique label. By setting the value argument, the user can decide which value to output. To know more about output values, see Terraform\u2019s documentation. You can now apply your changes; expect to wait about 30 minutes for your project to be in Ready state. Task 7: Project User Attachments \u00b6 Note For this task, please write all your code in the file task7.tf at the root of the workshop/directory. Now that your project is in Ready state, you can attach some users to it. Declare a project user attachment resource with the following for_each argument, replacing with the label you gave the taikun_user resource. for_each = { for user in resource.taikun_user.<label> : user.id => user if user.role == \"User\" } With this block, you will be able to attach only users with the User role to the project. To know more about this syntax, see the documentation on for expressions. Finally, set the proper values for the user_id and **project_id arguments and apply your changes.","title":"Terraform Provider"},{"location":"guidelines/terraform-provider/#terraform-provider-for-taikun-workshop","text":"User Manager Partner","title":"Terraform Provider for Taikun Workshop"},{"location":"guidelines/terraform-provider/#introduction","text":"The purpose of this workshop is to introduce you to Terraform and the Terraform Provider for Taikun.

Thus, in task3.tf*, insert the following variable declarations variable \"openstack_url\" { description = \"OpenStack url\" type = string sensitive = true } variable \"openstack_user\" { description = \"OpenStack user\" type = string sensitive = true } variable \"openstack_password\" { description = \"OpenStack password\" type = string sensitive = true } variable \"openstack_domain\" { description = \"OpenStack domain\" type = string sensitive = true } variable \"openstack_region\" { description = \"OpenStack region\" type = string } variable \"openstack_public_network\" { description = \"OpenStack public network\" type = string } variable \"openstack_project\" { description = \"OpenStack project name\" type = string } Note If copy-pasting this code block into task3.tf does not indent the code properly, save task3.tf and run terraform fmt. Now that the OpenStack variables have been declared, define the variables in task3.auto.tfvars using your credentials. Terraform must be told through command line arguments which .tfvars files to read. However, if variable definition files have the extension .auto.tfvars, as is the case with taikun_auth.auto.tfvars, Terraform will automatically fetch the variables\u2019 values. Tip As a reminder, here is the syntax used in taikun_auth.auto.tfvars to define the variables taikun_email and taikun_password. taikun_email = \"jane.doe@itera.io\" taikun_password = \"PassWord123\" Tip In order to get a variable\u2019s value, use the syntax var. . For example, the following line sets the OpenStack domain in the cloud_credential_openstack resource. domain = var.openstack_domain Once you have declared your new resource, apply your changes and move on to the next task. Important As always, your resources should belong to the organization created in Task 0: Organization","title":"Task 3: Cloud Credentials"},{"location":"guidelines/terraform-provider/#task-4-users","text":"Note For this task, please write your code in the file task4.tf at the root of the workshop/directory. You will also be editing users.tf and users.auto.tfvars . You will now add users to the Taikun organization. As the organization could have a large amount of users, you will use variables and the keyword for_each to avoid declaring multiple taikun_user blocks. Add the following variable declaration to users.tf . variable \"users\" { type = map(object({ email = string role = string })) description = \"List of project users\" default = {} } The users variable is of a complex type: a map of objects with two arguments, email and role. The keys of the map are strings, they will be the usernames of the users. The default = {} argument definition tells Terraform that the default value of var.users is an empty map. Here is an example definition of the users variable. users = { \"alice\" = { email = \"alice@gmail.com\" role = \"Manager\" }, \"bob\" = { email = \"bob@gmail.com\" role = \"User\" }, } In this example, user accounts are defined for Alice and Bob. \u2022 Alice has a Manager account with the username alice and the email alice@gmail.com . \u2022 Bob has a User account with the username bob and the email bob@gmail.com . Now edit users.auto.tfvars and define three users. \u2022 -manager with Manager role and the email -manager@mail.example. \u2022 -user1 with User role and the email -user1@mail.example. \u2022 -user2 with User role and the email -user2@mail.example. Replace with a name of your choosing. You can now declare the user resource in task4.tf, the users must belong to the organization created in Task 0: Organization. Here is its documentation. By using the for_each keyword, only one resource block is needed. Tip Here is an example using the for_each keyword. Consider a Terraform provider to order pizzas. Sup- pose the variable pizza_orders has the following definition. pizza_orders = { \"alice\" = { type = \"pepperoni\" size = \"large\" }, \"bob\" = { type = \"amatriciana\" size = \"medium\" }, } Here is how it would be used with the for_each keyword in a pizza_order resource. resource \"pizza_order\" \"orders\" { for_each = var.pizza_orders client = each.key type = each.value.type size = each.value.size } You can also have a look at Terraform\u2019s for_each documentation. Once you have declared the user resource, apply your changes and move on to the next task.","title":"Task 4: Users"},{"location":"guidelines/terraform-provider/#task-5-access-profile","text":"Note For this task, please write your code in the file task5.tf at the root of the workshop/directory. You will also be editing users.tf and users.auto.tfvars. Before creating your first project, you will need an access profile. The access profile must contain SSH keys for all the users created in the previous task, Task 4: Users. Rather than declare the SSH keys in a separate variable, you will add them to the users variable to declare them on per user basis. Modify users\u2019s declaration in users.tf to include a list of SSH users per user. variable \"users\" { type = map(object({ email = string role = string ssh_users = list(object({ name = string public_key = string })) })) description = \"List of project users\" default = {} } You can now edit users.auto.tfvars and define a list of SSH users for each user. Considering the previous example of Alice and Bob, here is the same definition of users with added SSH users. users = { \"alice\" = { email = \"alice@gmail.com\" role = \"Manager\" ssh_users = [ { name = \"alice-work\" public_key = \"ssh-ed25519 AAAATHEQUICKBROWNFOXJUMPEDOVERTHELAZYDOG example\" }, { name = \"alice-home\" public_key = \"ssh-ed25519 AAAATHEQUICKBROWNFOXJUMPEDOVERTHELAZYDOG example\" } ] }, \"bob\" = { email = \"bob@gmail.com\" role = \"User\" ssh_users = [ { name = \"bob-laptop\" public_key = \"ssh-ed25519 AAAATHEQUICKBROWNFOXJUMPEDOVERTHELAZYDOG example\" } ] }, } Add as many SSH users as you wish to the users defined in the previous task. Of course, you will need to use valid SSH keys. If you do not wish to create your own, here is a public key value you can use: ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIB/8P0zXmI/Il81+/fnvGrf0X/VyNTrOJ9nQCxBxjc5m taikun Important Within one access profile, the names of SSH users must be unique. You can now declare the taikun_access_profile resource in task5.tf . You will use for_each in a slightly different manner as ssh_user is a nested resource within the access_profile resource. Here is the documen- tation of the access profile resource. The access profile\u2019s requirements are: \u2022 It should use the DNS servers 8.8.8.8 and 1.1.1.1. \u2022 It should use the NTP server time.windows.com. \u2022 It should include all the SSH users defined in users.auto.tfvars. Tip While reading access profile\u2019s schema, you may notice dns_server and ntp_server are of the type Block List. Going back to the pizza order example, here is how block lists are used. Suppose the pizza_order resource has an argument extra_topping defined as such: - extra_topping (Block List, Max: 5) List of extra pizza toppings. (see below for nested schema) Nested Schema for extra_topping Required: - name (String) Name of the extra topping - quantity (Number) Quantity Here is how Alice could add mozzarella di bufala and basil to her amatriciana pizza order. resource \"pizza_order\" \"orders\" { client = \"alice\" type = \"amatriciana\" size = \"large\" extra_topping { name = \"basil leaves\" quantity = 8 } extra_topping { name = \"bufala slices\" quantity = 4 } } Note The code to define the SSH users of the access profile is provided below. However, if you wish to give it a go yourself first, here is how. To define the ssh_user argument, you will need to use a dynamic block with the for_each keyword. You will also need to extract the list of all SSH users from the users variable. for expressions and the flatten function will be of use. Spoiler ahead! Solution: Add the following dynamic \"ssh_user\" block to your access profile\u2019s configuration. resource \"taikun_access_profile\" \"...\" { # Rest of configuration: DNS servers, NTP servers, etc. # ... dynamic \"ssh_user\" { for_each = flatten([for user in var.users : user.ssh_users]) content { name = ssh_user.value.name public_key = ssh_user.value.public_key } } } Once you have fully declared the access profile resource, apply your changes and move on to the next task.","title":"Task 5: Access Profile"},{"location":"guidelines/terraform-provider/#task-6-project","text":"Note For this task, please write all your code in the file task6.tf at the root of the workshop/directory. Finally, you can declare a project resource. However, as flavors must be bound to the project, you must first fetch a list of suitable flavors. To do this, declare a flavors datasource. Datasources, as opposed to resources, only fetch information from providers and do not create any resources. Add the following block to task6.tf . data \"taikun_flavors\" \"small\" { # FIXME } Tip As you are declaring a datasource and not a resource, the block begins with the keyword data instead of resource. Once again, the type of datasource is in lowercase and must be prefixed by the name of the provider. Finally, the label \"small\" is used to designate this datasource. Edit the datasource to search for flavors with 4 or fewer CPUs and no more than 8GB of RAM. Set its cloud credential ID to that of the cloud credential created in Task 3: Cloud Credentials. Then declare a local value flavors to be the list of names of the flavors read by the datasource. See the Terraform documentation to know more about local values. locals { flavors = [for flavor in data.taikun_flavors.small.flavors : flavor.name] } This will allow you to refer to the list of flavor names with local.flavors, which will be useful when defining the project. You now have everything you need to create a project in Taikun. Here is its documentation. These are the requirements for the project resource: \u2022 As all previous resources, it must belong to the organization created in Task 0: Organization. \u2022 It must use the kubernetes profile defined in Task 1: Kubernetes Profile. \u2022 Its alerting profile must be the one defined in Task 2: Slack Configuration & Alerting Profile. \u2022 It should use the cloud credentials defined in Task 3: Cloud Credentials. \u2022 Monitoring must be enabled. \u2022 It should have one bastion, one kubemaster and one kubeworker. Tip To access the first element of a list, use the syntax list[index]. For example, to get the first flavor read by the flavors datasource, use local.flavors[0] . After creating a project with Terraform, one may want to know its access IP. Once you have declared the project resource, add the following output block to task6.tf . output \"project_access_ip\" { value = resource.taikun_project.<project-label>.access_ip } Make sure to replace with the label you gave your project. This will display the project\u2019s access IP once it has been created.- Tip Output values are a way for the user to output a specific value from Terraform\u2019s state. An output value block begins with the keyword output followed by a unique label. By setting the value argument, the user can decide which value to output. To know more about output values, see Terraform\u2019s documentation. You can now apply your changes; expect to wait about 30 minutes for your project to be in Ready state.","title":"Task 6: Project"},{"location":"guidelines/terraform-provider/#task-7-project-user-attachments","text":"Note For this task, please write all your code in the file task7.tf at the root of the workshop/directory.

Fig .1: Accessing project's details Project Info \u00b6 Under Servers title is a brief description of the project - such as Project , Project Status , Cloud Type , Kubernetes Version , Access Profile , Cloud Credentials , Kubernetes Profile , Alerting Profile , Policy Profile , Access IP Address (if you use this address to ssh connect, please do not use user ubuntu, it's in use by Taikun for managing the cluster) and Kubernetes Health . Some of these include links to e.g. cloud or profiles. Fig .2: Brief project info You can also see here ETC=Estimated Time to Complete. It is approx time (in minutes) until the cluster will be completed. Servers \u00b6 Every server is described by ID , Server Name , IP Address , Flavor , CPU/RAM/Disk Size , Role , Status, K8s Health , Created and Actions . If you expand the table, you can see Created By , Last Modified and Last Modified By . Fig .3: Servers for project Server status can be: Deleting Failure Pending Pending Delete Pending Upgrade Ready Updating Upgrading Actions Show Status - shows current status from the cloud for 3 seconds Reboot - choose HARD or SOFT reboot for each server HARD - the power to the system is physically turned off and back again causing an initial boot SOFT - system restarts without the need to interrupt the power Info Hard or soft reboot can be chosen only for Openstack. For AWS and Azure there is only simple reboot available. Action Buttons \u00b6 Upgrade \u00b6 Upgrade your version of Kubespray to the latest one. The button is disabled, if your Kubernetes are up to date. Enabling auto upgrade during the project creation, the Upgrade button won't be available. Enable/Disable Backup \u00b6 You can Enable Backup if you have added the credentials in Backup Credentials and the project isn't locked. You can do it during the project creation or after the project is created, more info here . After you enable the backup, you get notified through Notification and you can check the successful status in Kubernetes. In Projects - Kubernetes - Deployment section you should see velero installed. Fig .4: Velero tool After enabling backup, you need to add Backup Policies . Enforce Policies \u00b6 If you haven't chosen Policy Profile during project creation , you can do it after project is created. First create a new profile in Policy Profiles and then enforce the policy . Fig .5: Enforce policy Disable the policy the same way. Enable/Disable Monitoring \u00b6 Be able to see detailed processes with enabling monitoring. After you enable it, which takes up to 5 minutes, you can preview all tracks with Logs button. The tracking starts the moment Logs button is enabled. You can enable monitoring before project creation or (if you forgot or have changed your mind) whenever your project is created. Disable function works the same. Commit \u00b6 Sends the changes to repository. Once the cluster is committed you will see ETC in project info. Repair \u00b6 When the server/s are Failed or there is some other problem in the cluster, use repair button. Fig .6: Repair Attach/Detach Alerting Profile \u00b6 Attach Alerting Profile if you want to receive a notifications about alerts in your project. Detach if notifications are no longer needed. Lock/Unlock \u00b6 Lock / Unlock Project is unlocked Clicking the button you lock a project. You can preview some pages (e.g. K8s Info ), but you can't make any changes in the project (see Project Details - Project info . Project is locked Clicking the button you unlock a project and enable action buttons. Add Server \u00b6 To create a new server click button and fill all the fields. You will receive an error message if no flavor has been bound to your project yet. You can also bind the flavor during project creation. Use the link to bind a flavor. Fig .7: Add server Server Name - only alphanumeric characters and dash are allowed, 1-30 characters Warning Letters must be lowercase! Disk size - should be at least 30GB Role - you are able to choose from several roles for your servers, which are set according to the Kubernetes settings Number of Servers - set number for kubeworker or kubemaster, add odd number of masters (min. 3 for a highly available cluster) Warning The change MUST be committed. Flavor - choose from the list of offered flavors (e.g. n0.xlarge) you can bind the flavors from clouds to the project in Flavor Info Info Recommendation for sizing: bastion recommended 2 vCPU + 2GB of RAM masters recommended 4 vCPU + 8GB of RAM Kubernetes Node Labels - label nodes where you want to sent or restrict pods; you can add more labels with add label button, for more info see Kubernetes docs For more information see Creating a cluster . Delete \u00b6 Delete the selected server/s. You can delete servers to still have a working cluster (1 bastion, 1 master and 1 worker) or delete the whole working cluster. Warning The change DOES NOT have to be committed. Function buttons \u00b6 Under Add Server are buttons with specific features or more detailed information. History \u00b6 This button will redirect you to Audit Log with project, so you can preview the changes made for the chosen project. Fig .8: History Kubeconfigs \u00b6 Add a new kubernetes configuration for your profile and project. Fig .9: Add kube config Name - choose a name for your kubeconfig (2-230 characters) Kubeconfig Role cluster-admin - perform any action on any resource, ClusterRoleBinding - gives full control over every resource in the cluster and in all namespaces (or in very resource in the role binding's namespace - RoleBinding) admin - RoleBinding - allows read/write access to most resources in a namespace, does not allow write access to resource quota or to the namespace itself edit - allows read/write access to most objects in a namespace, does not allow viewing or modifying roles or role bindings, allows accessing Secrets and running Pods as any ServiceAccount in the namespace view - see most objects in a namespace, does not allow viewing roles or role bindings, does not allow viewing Secrets Info For more info, see kubernetes documentation . Application kubeconfig - choose if kubeconfig can be used by other users ( all or managers only ) or Personal kubeconfig - kubeconfig can be used only by you ( Target User is empty) or choose user you want to create the kubeconfig for You can see all project's configurations in the table with its ID , Name , User Name , User Role , Project , Accessible for all and Actions . Fig .10: Kube configs Actions This .yaml file can be download and use to organize information about clusters, users, namespaces, and authentication mechanisms. Delete your kube config if it is no longer needed. You can also delete user's or partner's kube configs. K8s Info \u00b6 If Kubernetes is active, Kube Info button will redirect you to the Kubernetes configuration. For more see Projects - Kubernetes . Events \u00b6 You are redirected to Events, where you can see all Kubernetes changes made in the project. To preview details for more information to each action use button. A green strip indicates a successful action, a brown strip indicates a failed action. You can sort Events by: Search field Filling Start and End Date Tick Only failed to filter failed actions Fig .11: Events Logs \u00b6 Preview Kubernetes cluster logs to Grafana. Logs button is disabled if Monitoring is disabled . To view logs, you must first Enable Monitoring . Fig .12: Logs Write your query and use Start date and End Date for sorting.

This section is refreshed every 5 minutes, but you can also use the refresh button to see the most updated data. Fig .14: Firing alerts To see all alerts, use upper right Show All Alerts button. As seen above, firing alerts are marked with red color. You can silence alert and sort all the alerts by firing, silenced, all or resolved. Alerts are accessible only if Monitoring is enabled and the project is not empty. Fig .15: Alerts For each alert you can see details and use a link that will redirected you to Metrics with the query already filled. The index number at Alerts shows the number of firing alerts. When the firing alerts are resolved, the number disappears. Firing alerts also work from the real-time notifications bell in header. Fig .16: Alerts bell The notification contains a brief message on a specific project and bellow the message is time of the change. After clicking Show Project , you can access the project in which the alert is. As the name suggests: Mark as Read and Dismiss all . Metrics \u00b6 Write a query, search Prometheus Metrics and preview the value needed. Modify Step or Date . Switch between Console and Graph for better results.

Enable/Disable Monitoring \u00b6 Be able to see detailed processes with enabling monitoring. After you enable it, which takes up to 5 minutes, you can preview all tracks with Logs button. The tracking starts the moment Logs button is enabled. You can enable monitoring before project creation or (if you forgot or have changed your mind) whenever your project is created. Disable function works the same. Commit \u00b6 Sends the changes to repository. Once the cluster is committed you will see ETC in project info. Repair \u00b6 When the server's are Failed or there is some other problem in the cluster, it can be repaired by changing the status to Ready . If all the servers have failed during the first creation, the repair button works as commit and you should use it. If only one server is failed, you should change only the one server's status, because repair will restart the status of all servers.
